# rustpunk

An extreamly opinionated Cyberpunk Rust bundle for Visual Studio Code.

This setup should work for Windows, Linux and OSX out of the box.


## Releases

0.2.2

LiveServer and OrgMode just were not constnatly used so they've been booted off.

Spellchecker, TODO highlighter and Gremlin highlighter have been added in as they have each been very helpful (Gremlin checker infrequently stops some real headbanging moments).
